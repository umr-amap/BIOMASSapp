If you choose: 

- "The height of some trees in the same dataset": you will be able to estimate unmeasured tree heights by building a local Height–Diameter (H-D) allometry model on the measured trees
- "A subset of well-measured trees in another dataset": you will be able to estimate tree heights by building a local Height–Diameter (H-D) allometry model on the measured trees of the dataset
