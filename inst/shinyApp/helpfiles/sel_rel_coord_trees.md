The relative tree coordinates refer to the columns "Xfield", "Yfield" in the example provided in the first tab of this app (Forest inventory file: download an example).

If you do not have the relative tree coordinates and do not want to divide your plots into sub-plots, this section is not relevant to you. We assume that you can summarise any tree metrics by plot yourself.
