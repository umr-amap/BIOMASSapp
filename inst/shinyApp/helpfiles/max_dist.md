When multiple GPS measurements have been recorded for each corner (for more information, see the [CEOS good practices protocol, section A.1.3.1](https://lpvs.gsfc.nasa.gov/PDF/CEOS_WGCV_LPV_Biomass_Protocol_2021_V1.0.pdf)), the coordinates will be averaged by corner, resulting in 4 reference coordinates. By default, any corner more than 15 meters away from the averaged reference corner will be removed and the reference corner will be recalculated.
