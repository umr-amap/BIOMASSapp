Two situations may occur:

* The **GPS coordinates** of the plot corners are considered **very accurate** or **enough measurements have been made** to be confident in the accuracy of their average. In this case, the shape of the plot measured on the field will follow exactly the GPS coordinates of the plot corners.

* **Too few measurements of the GPS coordinates** of plot corners have been collected and/or are **not reliable**. In this case, **the shape of the plot measured on the field is considered to be accurate** and the GPS corner coordinates will be recalculated to fit the shape and dimensions of the plot.
