If you have a raster file of the study area(typically a CHM raster derived from LiDAR data), you can upload it to extract the raster values and compare them with those of any other tree metric at the subplot level.

If your raster file does not contain all the plots in your forest inventory dataset, you will need to split the dataset according to the areas covered by the CHM and repeat the analysis.
