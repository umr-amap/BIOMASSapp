An uncertainty of 0.07 g.cm-3 is assumed by default, corresponding to the mean standard deviation observed at the species level in the global wood density database, when at least 10 individuals are considered.
To obtain automatic estimations of wood density uncertainties, do not specify the wood density; instead, specify the genus and species of the trees.
