* **results at subplot level** follows the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0196-1" target="_blank">Forest Observation System initiative</a>. It contains:
- the coordinates of the centre of the subplots (Lon_cnt//Lat_cnt)
- the number of trees (Ndens)
- the minimum and maximum diameter (Min/MaxDBH)
- the basal area per hectare (BA)
- the mean of wood density values (WD)
- the estimated Lorey's height (H_Lorey_) and maximum height(H_max_)
- the AGBD, along with the confidence intervals limits for each height estimation method (AGBD_ and AGBD_cred_2.5_)
- the metrics that you have included by clicking on "Summarised"

* **Shapefile results** are the same as above but in a modern shapefile format (geopackage, .gpkg) which can easily be imported into GIS software such as QGIS. 

* Clicking on **Download report** will produce an automated HTML report summarising the different steps and modelling choices that led to the final metric summaries.
