Three methods are proposed for estimating tree heights:

- If the height of some trees in the forest inventory has been measured, or if a subset of well-measured trees is available in the studied region, a local height–diameter allometry model can be built to predict the heights of unmeasured trees. This is done by checking **Local HD model**.
- If not, the coordinates of the plots/trees will be used to predict tree heights using:
  + the region-specific H–D models proposed by Feldpausch et al. (2012) by checking **Feldpausch**.
  + the generic H–D model based on a single bioclimatic predictor E (eqn 6a in Chave et al. 2014) by checking **Chave**.
