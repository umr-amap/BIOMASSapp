* **Tree level results** contains the forest inventory dataset, along with the corrected taxonomy, wood density predictions and associated uncertainties, and predictions of basal area, tree height and biomass.
* **Plot-level results** follows the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0196-1" target="_blank">Forest Observation System initiative</a>. It contains the number of trees (Ndens), the minimum and maximum diameter (Min/MaxDBH), the basal area (BA), the mean of wood density values (MeanWD), the estimated Lorey's height (H_Lorey_), maximum height(H_max_) and AGB (along with the confidence intervals limits) for each height estimation method. 
* The **Download report** button will produce an automated HTML report summarising the different steps and modelling choices that led to the final biomass estimates.
