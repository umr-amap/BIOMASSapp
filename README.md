# BIOMASSapp

## Description
BIOMASSapp is the Shiny application of the R BIOMASS package. It allows the user to estimate above-ground biomass and its uncertainty in tropical forests. This application  allows to (1) retrieve and correct tree taxonomy, (2) estimate wood density and its uncertainty, (3) build height-diameter models, (4) estimate above-ground biomass at stand level with associated uncertainty.
